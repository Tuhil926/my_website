      I'm Tuhil, a student at IIT Hyderabad. I'm currently studying Computer
      Science and Engineering here, and have finished my 4th semester.My
      interests lie in game dev, networking and web dev as of now, and I'm
      planning to explore cyber-security as well as machine learning in my
      coming semesters. Anyways, this is not my resume, I'll talk about my other
      interests. I love music production, and I make music in the EDM genre. EDM
      is an umbrella term, but I can't really pin down my style of music to a
      particular genre. But I like making melodic songs with a house type beat.
      Now, I'm no expert in EDM or music production, I just do this as a hobby.
      Ny other big interest is game development. Although when I look back at
      what I've made so far, all i've got us some small games and a bunch of
      unfinished projects. I'll talk more about my game dev on that page.
